## Problem

You want to secure your Ignite API endpoints with basic authentication.

## Solution

Drag and drop an <code class="node">Http in</code> node to receive the http requests.
Use a <code class="node">basic-auth</code> node and configure the settings.
Drag and drop two <code class="node">Function</code> nodes and set the response for good and bad cases.
Use an <code class="node">Http response</code> node to send the response back to the client

## Discussion

This flow verifies the Authorization header of an incoming request against the one defined within the basic-auth settings.

This method is vastly supported including Salesforce Connect with OData Services.
